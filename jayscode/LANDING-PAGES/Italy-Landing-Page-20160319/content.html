Savor the unique wines and flavors of the Valpolicella region, including a luscious risotto at a wine estate owned by descendants of Dante Alighieri. Enjoy a full-day excursion to Bologna, where you’ll make your own pasta at a hands-on workshop. And discover the islands of Venice’s lagoon, including Mazzorbo, home to a rare golden-hued wine made from Dorona grapes, a highly prized vintage during the Renaissance.

                                        For spiritual seekers, a journey to Italy is—in a word—sublime. In Milan, get a firsthand look at one of Da Vinci’s greatest works, the original <em>The Last Supper</em>, possibly the world’s best-known religious painting. Venture inside St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice on an exceptionally rare after-hours visit available exclusively to Uniworld guests. Visit the Venetian island of Torcello and its Byzantine-style basilica adorned with stunning decorative mosaics of the Virgin Mary and the Last Judgment—we’ve arranged an exclusive early opening so you can admire the mosaics in complete privacy. Guests on our <a href="/cruises/europe/Splendors-of-Italy/2016">Splendors of Italy</a> itinerary can continue their adventure in Florence and Rome, exploring the marvelous artwork within the Vatican Museums and St. Paul’s Basilica, and savor an unforgettable look at Michelangelo’s stunning Sistine Chapel frescoes.

                                        Our 10-day <a href="/cruises/europe/Gems-of-Northern-Italy/2016">Gems of Italy</a> cruise/tour provides an in-depth look at cultural traditions that have endured for centuries. The colorful island of Burano, for example—one of Venice’s most enchanting outer islands—is famous for its lace, a beautiful art form requiring vast amounts of patience and absurdly nimble fingers. The women of the island have been experts at making intricately patterned lace since the 1400s, when Leonardo da Vinci himself visited Burano to shop for cloth. Elsewhere in the city, there are a mind-boggling number of artisan workshops and galleries devoted to hand-blown glass and exquisitely crafted Venetian masks, many of which are meticulously hand-painted, gilded in gold leaf, and decorated with natural feathers and semi-precious gems.

                                        For art and architecture aficionados with a bit more time to linger, Uniworld’s <a href="/cruises/europe/Splendors-of-Italy/2016">Splendors of Italy</a> provides a meticulously planned itinerary, continuing on from Venice to visit the birthplace of the Renaissance, Florence, and the “Eternal City” of Rome. In Florence, admire some of the city’s most glorious monuments, including the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore and the Florence Baptistry, the Uffizi Gallery, the Piazza della Repubblica, the Ponte Vecchio, and Santa Croce—where Michelangelo, Galileo and Machiavelli are buried—and cross the Arno to see the Pitti Palace and the old merchant quarter. In Rome, explore the ancient Colosseum and Forum and take in the majesty of the Sistine Chapel, with its spectacular ceiling frescoes by Michelangelo, and St. Peter’s Basilica—the largest church in Rome and one of the largest in the world—topped by an extraordinary dome designed by Michelangelo. After an exciting day full of glorious sightseeing, do as the Romans do and stroll the streets of the city after dark, when fashionable locals gather under the stars at chic eateries and you can catch—just for a moment—intimate glimpses into everyday life in this timeless locale. <em>Buona notte, Italia!</em>
